# Witchcraft-Trials-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Final-Class-Project
## Executive Summary:
Using Python's Jupyter Notebook, I collaborated with two other students in order to clean and organize the data and create visualizations using packages such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib in order to answer some of the research questions we came up and found that:
1. Trials were at their peak during the 17th century . 
2. Trials occurred at a higher rate in colder weather and with less precipitation and so lack of crops from farms could've been a motivating factor.
3. Determined most that were accused of being a witch were those of lower and middle class.
